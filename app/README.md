## Usage

The interactive rating component allows users to:

- Submit the rating by clicking the submit button.
- After submission, users will see a "Thank you" card displaying their selected rating.

The project uses **Material UI** to create beautiful, responsive components with a modern design. The **Card** component from Material UI is used to wrap the rating form, and the app's styling is managed through Material UI's **theme** and **Styled Components**.

To modify the design, styles, or logic, you can explore the respective components and modify the code as needed.
